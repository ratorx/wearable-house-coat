## Connecting Hue in the Intel Lab
This has only been tested on Windows 10, but does work. I'm sure a similar setup works for Mac.
* Firstly, ensure that both all devices are connected wgb Wifi. This will **not** work with eduroam.
* Connect the Hue bridge to the laptop's ethernet. This may require an adapter depending on your laptop.
* Head to Settings -> Network & Internet -> Change adapter options.
* We need to connect the Wi-Fi and ethernet connection toegether. This allows the bridge to communicate with the Wi-Fi network and internet
* To do this, select the Wi-Fi and ethernet adapters, right click and select 'Add to Bridge'
* Now follow any in-app instructions to finish set up
